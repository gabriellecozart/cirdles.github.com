ET_Redux is CIRDLES' open source flagship cyber infrastructure product. ET_Redux was previously named U-Pb_Redux, but in January of 2015 was renamed to reflect its expanding functionality and its sponsor, [EARTHTIME](http://earth-time.org/).

ET_Redux currently serves the [ID-TIMS](http://cirdles.org/community/u-pb-idtims/) and [LAICP-MS](http://cirdles.org/community/u-pb-laicpms/) U-Pb geochronology communities as described.  We are currently funded by NSF to extend ET_Redux's architecture to [U-series](http://earthcube.org/group/cyberinfrastructure-u-series-geochronologic-data) analyses.

ET_Redux is a stand-alone desktop application that supports IDTIMS and LA-ICPMS U-Pb data reduction, uncertainty propagation, and visualization for any U-bearing phase.  It provides sophisticated graphical and statistical tools for data analysis and compilation.  These include interactive data tables, concordia and weighted mean plots, dynamic decomposition of uncertainties into contributions from individual sources, and algorithms for propagation of systematic uncertainties in tracer calibration and decay constants.  ET_Redux also generates these outputs as publication-ready vector graphics files.  

ET_Redux has pioneered the seamless integration of automated archiving of data and results into the NSF-sponsored [GeoChron](http://geochron.org) community database. ET_Redux produces a standardized output detailing analysis results as an 'aliquot' XML file that can exported to GeoChron or stored and shared as needed.  An important contribution is ET_Redux's compilation mode where one or several aliquot files from GeoChron or elsewhere can be compiled and visualized together, giving the user instant access to large published datasets. 

The integration with GeoChron requires the registration of samples through the System for Earth Sample Registration ([SESAR](http://www.geosamples.org/)), which provides unique International GeoSample Numbers ([IGSN](http://www.igsn.org/)) for each sample and aliquot.  In order for you to take advantqage of this system, you need to register once for a GeoPass as explained [here](http://cirdles.org/projects/et_redux/#what-is-geopass).
